### Global Monit configurations. This file has 000 prepended to its
### name so that is the first to be loaded by monit.

## Start Monit in the background (run as a daemon):
set daemon  120           # check services at 2-minute intervals
    with start delay 240  # optional: delay the first check by 4-minutes (by
                          # default Monit check immediately after Monit start)

## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, Monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to
## a standalone log file instead, specify the full path to the log file
set logfile syslog facility log_daemon

## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be
## specified using a comma separator. By default Monit uses port 25 - it is
## possible to override this with the PORT option. 
set mailserver localhost # primary mailserver

## Alert root. There should be a forward from root to a non-privileged
## user.
set alert root@localhost

## By default Monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available.
## If you want to keep the alerts for later delivery retry, you can use the
## EVENTQUEUE statement. The base directory where undelivered alerts will be
## stored is specified by the BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue
## size using the SLOTS option (if omitted, the queue is limited by space
## available in the back end filesystem).
set eventqueue
    basedir /var/monit  # set the base directory where events will be stored
    slots 100           # optionally limit the queue size


## Monit has an embedded web server which can be used to view status of
## services monitored and manage services from a web interface. See the
## Monit Wiki if you want to enable SSL for the web server.
set httpd port 2812 and
    use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
    allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and
    allow appa:MntT126     # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'

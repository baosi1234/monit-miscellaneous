* Monit configuration files

** Introduction

   This is a bunch of monit configuration files for monitoring a
   variety of things. 

** Monitored services

   1. Courier

   2. Exim

   3. Memcached

   4. MySQL: the default setup uses UNIX sockets. It has also the support
      for TCP sockets commented out. 

   5. Nginx

   6. php-cgi (FastCGI)

   7. Postfix

   8. SSH

** Web interface

   The web interface is setup in the =000-global= file. The current
   setup is the one I use my dev machine setup. This is a standalone
   firewalled machine.

   If on the Internet then you **should** use a [[http://mmonit.com/wiki/Monit/EnableSSLInMonit][SSL setup]] for the web
   interface.

** Installation

   Copy the file(s) you're interested to =/etc/monit/conf.d=. Start or
   restart monit. Note that I'm assuming a Debian like directory
   hierarchy. =/etc -> /etc/monit/ -> /etc/monit/conf.d=

   The base configuration file =/etc/monit/monitrc= has as
   last statement the inclusion of all files in the =conf.d=
   subdirectory of =/etc/monit=.

   There's no tampering with the package installed =monitrc=. Instead
   all global settings are defined in a =000-global= file that due to
   its name is the first to be included in =monitrc= therefore making
   all statements there affect all other configuration files.

** Alerts

   All alerts are sent to =root@localhost= you should either/or define
   an alias/forward for root or alter the address in =000-global=.

   The mailserver is also localhost in port 25. Change it if necessary
   for your mail setup.
